# Auto Response System Keys
> <b>You no longer need to initiate by typing</b> `--auto`  
you can just start adding keys!  
  
Ok first let's look at the trigger section.  
You want to set this to whatever word/sentence you want Echo to respond to.  
  
  
<b>NEW: You can use the {params} key in the trigger to catch their text!</b> 
`--auto &--giveme {params}={role:{params}}{req:Owner}You've assumed the role {params}`
  
The example above `requires` you to have the role `Owner` and will give you  
whatever role you type (*As long as the role exists*) for example: `giveme Staff`  
  
  
If you want to use regex you add the <b>&</b> key before the word Example Below:  
`--auto &word=The Response here!`  
Want to add a work like `ass` to the word filter? but don't want to catch `mass`?  
Add a space after the word. this will assure it only triggers on the word! Example Below:  
`--auto &ass =The Response here!`  
  
Ok, now let's look at the <b>Response</b> section and all the keys you can use!  
<b>Keys</b> are surrounded by obraces. `{key}` Echo will replace these keys with data!  
Here's a list:
